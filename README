My first attempt making a jQuery plugin, following
the guidelines at: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring

Boids code adapted from Javascript Boids by Ben Dowling,
see: http://www.coderholic.com/javascript-boids/

If this is bound to the window resize event, then the 
jQuery resize event plugin by "Cowboy" Ben Alman
should be used as it throttles the window resize events.
